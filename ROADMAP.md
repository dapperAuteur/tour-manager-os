## Legend
- ✅ Complete
- 🚧 In Progress
- 📋 Planned
- 💡 Future

---

## Phase 1: Digital Advance Sheet + Itinerary ✅
> Replace Excel advance sheets with smart web forms that auto-generate daily itineraries.

- ✅ Tour CRUD (create, view, list tours)
- ✅ Show management (add shows to tours, status tracking)
- ✅ Public advance sheet form (token-based, no login required)
- ✅ Advance sheet with all venue fields (venue, dressing rooms, catering, production, show details, contacts, sound)
- ✅ Show detail page (displays all advance sheet data)
- ✅ Auto-generated daily itinerary view (schedule, venue, hotel, catering, contacts, merch)
- ✅ Print-friendly itinerary layout

## Phase 2: User Settings & App Foundation ✅
> Core app infrastructure, authentication, and personalization.

- ✅ Email/password authentication
- ✅ 6-digit OTP email login
- ✅ Password policy (16 chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols, no repeats)
- ✅ User profile (display name, bio, phone)
- ✅ Preferences (timezone, theme, home page, notifications)
- ✅ Global timezone picker — 80+ IANA zones grouped by region (US & Canada / Latin America / Europe & UK / Africa & Middle East / Asia / Australia, NZ & Pacific / UTC). Shared `<TimezoneSelect>` component wired into settings, the show-creation form, and any other timezone `<select>`. Replaces the old 8-option US-centric list so international tours don&apos;t have to settle for &ldquo;closest US zone&rdquo;.
- ✅ Light/dark/system theme with flash prevention
- ✅ Responsive nav sidebar with mobile drawer
- ✅ Logout functionality
- ✅ Branded Supabase email templates (confirmation, OTP, password reset)
- ✅ SVG favicon (music note)
- ✅ SEO (Open Graph, Twitter Cards, robots.txt, sitemap.xml)
- ✅ Vercel Analytics
- ✅ Vercel deployment with Supabase integration

## Phase 3: Module System & Feature Gating ✅
> Toggle features on/off per organization. Members opt in to modules.

- ✅ Module registry (11 modules seeded: advance-sheets, itineraries, finances, show-day, merch, fan-engagement, community, documents, production, academy, wellness)
- ✅ Organization creation and management
- ✅ Organization-level module toggle (admin enables/disables with switch controls)
- ✅ Member-level opt-in / request access with approval workflow
- ✅ Nav sidebar with Modules and Admin sections
- ✅ Per-module tutorial (3-5 step walkthrough on first access) — `TutorialGate` server component on `/today`, `/me/finances`, `/merch`, `/tours/[id]`; seed steps for show-day, finances, merch, advance-sheets, ticketing in migration 042; replay button on every gated page; progress per user via `user_tutorial_progress`

## Phase 4: Tour Money Tracker ✅
> Real-time P&L per show and per tour. Per-member financial views.

- ✅ Expense tracking by category (travel, hotel, per diem, meals, equipment, crew, merch, marketing, insurance, other)
- ✅ Add expense form with show association and tax-deductible flag
- ✅ Show revenue tracking (guarantee, ticket sales, merch, other)
- ✅ Tour P&L dashboard (total revenue, total expenses, net profit, expenses by category)
- ✅ Per-member financial view (/me/finances — expenses, payouts, owed, tax deductible)
- ✅ Member-to-member loan ledger — &ldquo;drummer borrowed $5 from guitarist&rdquo; tracked separately from tour P&amp;L. Both parties see the loan; either can mark it paid (with optional method — Venmo / cash / etc.). Open balance &ldquo;net&rdquo; surfaces at the top of `/me/finances` so you know who owes whom across the tour. New `member_loans` table; RLS restricted to lender / borrower / creator
- ✅ CSV export for expenses
- ✅ Settlements and member payouts tables
- ✅ Receipt capture with AI scanning — upload via `/api/expenses/extract-receipt`; Cloudinary stores the image; vision model (default `openrouter/anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`, swap via `vision_model` on `/admin/ai`) extracts amount/vendor/date/category/description/tax-deductible via Zod-validated `generateObject`; user reviews + edits before saving; `receipt_url` persists on the expense row
- 📋 Receipt image viewing linked to transactions
- ✅ Expense cost splitting between team members — `/tours/[id]/finances/expenses/[expenseId]` lets you split a paid expense into per-member shares (even-split or custom amounts) and `/me/finances` surfaces &ldquo;you owe&rdquo; / &ldquo;people owe you&rdquo; with a settle-via-Venmo/Zelle/etc. dropdown. New `expense_splits` table, RLS scoped to creator + share owner

## Phase 5: Show Day App ✅
> Mobile-first daily companion for each band member.

- ✅ "Today" view — hero daily view with schedule timeline, venue, hotel, catering, sound, merch, contacts
- ✅ Day navigation (prev/next between show dates)
- ✅ Tap-to-navigate (venue/hotel addresses open in Google Maps)
- ✅ Tap-to-call (all phone numbers are clickable)
- ✅ Timezone display (abbreviation shown next to all times)
- ✅ Travel info from previous show (distance, driver)
- ✅ Next destination preview
- ✅ Day off view when no show scheduled
- ✅ Push notifications for schedule changes — VAPID-signed web push via `web-push`; per-device subscriptions in `push_subscriptions`; opt-in toggle + "Send test" on `/settings`; `public/sw.js` shows the notification and routes the click to the URL the server embedded. Advance-sheet submission now fans out a `advance_submitted` push to every org member who opted in
- ✅ Weather integration (Open-Meteo, cached per show) — geocoding + 16-day forecast horizon, WMO-code-to-icon mapping, freshness rules (4h ≤ 14d out, 24h beyond), rendered as a `WeatherCard` near the show-day header

## Phase 6: Demo System ✅
> Pre-configured demo accounts with realistic data for try-before-you-buy.

- ✅ Demo users (Tour Manager, Band Member, Crew, Free/Read-Only)
- ✅ Single-button demo login — choose role, instant access, no signup
- ✅ Realistic seed data ("The Roadwell Family" — 2 tours, 12 shows, advance sheets, expenses, revenue, hotels, contacts)
- ✅ Demo banner with signup CTA shown on all authenticated pages
- ✅ Midnight data reset via Vercel cron job
- ✅ Full CRUD for demo users (data resets nightly)

## Phase 7: Landing Pages ✅
> Dedicated pages per user type and per module with demo login buttons.

- ✅ Main landing page — feature cards link to detail pages, user-type section, footer nav
- ✅ Per user type: /for/tour-managers, /for/musicians, /for/crew, /for/venues, /for/fans
- ✅ Per module: /features/[slug] for all 11 modules with benefits, user types, demo CTA
- ✅ Public roadmap page (/roadmap) with phase status and item checklists
- ✅ Sitemap updated with all public pages
- ✅ OG metadata on all landing pages
- ✅ Shared ecosystem-spec `SiteFooter` on every public page (homepage, `/pricing`, `/roadmap`, `/for/*`, `/features/*`, tickets, photos) — three-column nav (Ecosystem / Tour Manager OS / Partners & Legal), full Rise Wellness mental-health callout with verbatim non-affiliation disclaimer, sibling-product list, B4C LLC / AwesomeWebStore.com attribution

## Phase 8: Merch Empire ✅
> Inventory tracking, per-show sales, merch P&L.

- ✅ Product catalog (name, SKU, category, price, cost basis)
- ✅ Inventory tracking per tour (start quantity, remaining)
- ✅ Per-show merch sales recording with auto inventory update
- ✅ Merch P&L dashboard (revenue, cost, profit, units sold, top sellers)
- ✅ Demo data: 5 products, inventory, 11 sales across 3 shows
- ✅ Online merch store (Stripe Elements + Shippo live rates) at `/store/[org-slug]` — fan-facing public catalog grouped by category with per-product Buy buttons. Embedded Stripe Elements checkout at `/store/[org-slug]/checkout/[product-id]` walks the fan through Address → live Shippo rate quotes → Payment Element. Real shipping rates pulled from USPS/UPS/etc. based on product dimensions + destination. Webhook on `payment_intent.succeeded` records the order AND buys the Shippo label (PDF + tracking URL stored on the order). Falls back to legacy three-tier flat-rate hosted Stripe Checkout if Shippo isn&apos;t configured or the org hasn&apos;t set a ship-from address. New `merch_orders` + `merch_order_items` tables with order number, shipping address, Shippo references. Admin order list at `/merch/orders` shows paid → fulfilled flow with tracking-number capture. Idempotent on the Stripe session/intent id so redelivered webhooks don&apos;t double-insert. Product dimensions (weight/length/width/height) + ship-from address are self-serve via the editor + `/settings/ship-from`
- ✅ Tour-exclusive merch drops — flag a product as `is_exclusive`, pick a tour, set a visibility window (or leave blank to auto-gate by the tour's run). Storefront badges drops as &ldquo;Tour exclusive&rdquo; with an end date, and quietly hides them once the window closes

## Phase 9: Fan Marketing & Community ✅
> Email marketing and community discussion boards.

- ✅ Email list management (create lists, add subscribers manually)
- ✅ Email campaign builder (subject, content, list targeting, scheduling)
- ✅ Marketing dashboard (subscribers, lists, campaigns, sent count)
- ✅ Community categories (admin creates, members browse)
- ✅ Discussion posts with threaded replies
- ✅ Pin/lock posts (admin moderation)
- ✅ Author display names on posts and replies
- ✅ Email sending integration (Mailgun)
- ✅ CSV subscriber import
- ✅ Public event pages per show at `/shows/[id]` — fan-facing landing combining tour + venue header, doors/show/curfew times from the advance sheet, ticket-availability summary with a Buy Tickets CTA (deep-link to `/shows/[id]/tickets`), recent-fan-photo grid (deep-link to `/shows/[id]/photos`), setlist callout when one exists. Sharable URL. OG metadata for social posts. Auth show page exposes a &ldquo;Public event page&rdquo; deep link button
- ✅ Pre/post-show exclusive content — `show_exclusive_content` table holds per-show pieces with a `phase` (pre/post) and `unlock_offset_hours` relative to show-day midnight. Admin UI at `/tours/[id]/shows/[showId]/exclusive`; public event page renders a "Subscribers only" section where fans drop the email they signed up with and `/api/shows/[id]/exclusive` returns whatever pieces are inside their unlock window if the email is on any of the org&rsquo;s active subscriber lists

## Phase 10: Family Tour Hub ✅
> Polls, practice scheduling, shared albums, group collaboration.

- ✅ Family polls with multi-option voting, progress bars, open/close control
- ✅ Practice session scheduling with date/time/location and RSVP (going/maybe/can't)
- ✅ Shared photo/video albums per tour with media management
- ✅ Hub index page with Polls, Practice, Albums sections
- ✅ 404 pages (public and authenticated)
- ✅ Setlist collaboration (songs, comments, team discussion)
- ✅ Days-off planner (`/tours/[id]/days-off`) — derives off-days from tour range vs scheduled shows, per-day plans (rest/sightseeing/gym/spa/food/family/errands), group or personal, status toggle, Google Maps suggestion links

## Phase 11: Help & Feedback ✅
> Help center and conversational feedback system.

- ✅ Help center with searchable articles (7 seeded: getting started, advance sheets, finances, show day, merch, polls, accessibility)
- ✅ Article detail pages with markdown-like rendering
- ✅ Conversational feedback threads (bug/feature/question/praise)
- ✅ Threaded messages with sender names and admin badges
- ✅ Admin feedback management with status control (open → in_progress → resolved → closed)
- ✅ User-side &ldquo;Did this fix your issue?&rdquo; on every open feedback thread — reporter can confirm fixed (closes the thread + flips status to resolved) or signal still happening (re-opens for admin attention). System message posted into the thread. Admin queue surfaces a green &ldquo;User-confirmed&rdquo; or amber &ldquo;User: still happening&rdquo; badge.
- ✅ Admin sees user name on every thread with link context
- ✅ User notifications on admin replies
- ✅ Priority levels (low/normal/high/urgent)
- ✅ AI-powered help — pgvector semantic search via Mistral embeddings through the Vercel AI Gateway, LangSmith traceable, with fuzzy/ilike fallback if the embedding service is unavailable. Admin-only POST `/api/admin/help/backfill-embeddings` re-indexes after model changes
- ✅ Conversational help agent — RAG over published help articles, streaming responses via Cerebras Llama 3.3 70B by default (swap with `AI_CHAT_MODEL`), inline source citations, grounded refusal when context is missing
- ✅ Admin AI management at `/admin/ai` — super-admin-only. Hot-swap model per use case (DB override → env → default), provider key presence checks, LangSmith status, embeddings stats + backfill, on-demand provider health probes, last-20 agent activity with tokens + retrieval metadata. Dropdown-only model picker with pricing tier badges (Free / Free-tier / Pay / Gateway) + cost-per-1M tokens sourced from `lib/ai/pricing.ts`
- ✅ WitUS Inbox mirror — every user feedback/bug/question (the `/feedback/new` form, follow-up user replies, and the HelpBubble FAB) is mirrored, non-blocking, to the cross-product WitUS Inbox (`inbox.witus.online`), which auto-forwards to the WitUS Triage agent. Supabase stays the system of record; bugs ride the high-priority lane. BAM triages every WitUS product from one place. Requires `INBOX_INGEST_URL` / `INBOX_SOURCE_SLUG` / `INBOX_INGEST_SECRET`

## Phase 12: Admin Dashboard ✅
> Analytics, metrics, logs, user management.

- ✅ Admin dashboard (/admin/dashboard) — platform stats: users, orgs, tours, shows
- ✅ Financial metrics — total revenue, expenses, merch revenue across all orgs
- ✅ Feedback metrics — total threads, open/in-progress count
- ✅ User management (/admin/users) — all users with email, org, role, paid status, join date, last sign-in
- ✅ Activity logs (/admin/logs) — action, user, resource, timestamp
- ✅ Fuzzy search on help articles and feedback threads (pg_trgm)
- ✅ Reusable search bar component
- ✅ Unfinished phase tracker (/admin/unfinished) — single-page admin view of every 📋 item grouped by phase, audit-drift items at top (Recharts dashboard, smart advance pre-fill, multi-stage venues), and recently-shipped log; structured data in `lib/admin/unfinished-tracker.ts` mirrors `plans/02-unfinished-tracker.md`
- ✅ User engagement metrics — DAU / WAU / MAU + stickiness (DAU÷MAU) computed from `activity_log` over 1/7/30-day windows, surfaced as stat cards plus a 30-day DAU bar trend on `/admin/dashboard`
- ✅ Module adoption rates — per-module bar chart on `/admin/dashboard` (% of orgs with the module enabled and count of members actively opted in), sourced from `org_modules` + `member_module_access`
- ✅ Charts and graphs (Recharts) — line for growth, bar for module adoption + DAU trend, pie for user-type breakdown, all live on `/admin/dashboard`

## Phase 13: Academy / LMS ✅
> Courses teaching users how to use the platform.

- ✅ Course catalog with difficulty levels and estimated time
- ✅ Lesson viewer with markdown rendering (headings, lists, bold)
- ✅ Per-user lesson and course progress tracking
- ✅ Quiz system with multiple choice, scoring, and explanations
- ✅ Lesson navigation (prev/next within course)
- ✅ 3 seeded courses (8 lessons, 2 quizzes)
- ✅ Certificates of completion (PDF) — `/api/academy/courses/[slug]/certificate` generates a one-page A4-landscape PDF via `pdf-lib` (display name + course title + completion date + verification ID), gated by the user&rsquo;s `user_course_progress` row being `completed`. Course page shows a green &ldquo;Course complete&rdquo; banner with a download button once unlocked
- ✅ Admin course/lesson editor — `/admin/academy` lists every course (published + draft); `/admin/academy/courses/new` + `/admin/academy/courses/[id]` provide CRUD for the course settings (title, slug, category, difficulty, estimated minutes, sort order, published) plus an embedded lesson editor (title, slug, markdown body, video URL, sort order, published) with inline add/edit/delete
- ✅ Video lesson support — `videoEmbedFor()` recognises YouTube (watch/shorts/youtu.be/embed), Vimeo, Loom, and direct mp4/webm/mov URLs and returns an embed shape. Lesson page renders a responsive 16:9 video container above the markdown body when `lessons.video_url` is set; unsupported URLs fall back to a &ldquo;Watch lesson video&rdquo; external link. Course outline rows show a small &ldquo;Video&rdquo; badge so learners know which lessons include one
- ✅ Admin education tool (5-lesson course: Stripe, email, Supabase, Vercel, codebase for presentations)

## Phase 14: Musician Tax Platform ✅
> State-by-state tax tracking, deductions, year-end export.

- ✅ Tax Center dashboard (gross income, deductions, per diem, states count)
- ✅ State-by-state income tracker with progress bars
- ✅ Deduction breakdown with IRS guidance notes per category
- ✅ 15 musician-specific deduction categories seeded
- ✅ Per diem tracking table
- ✅ Year selector (5-year range)
- ✅ Income detail table
- ✅ CSV tax export (state + deduction summaries + detail records)
- ✅ QuickBooks / Xero export — `/api/finances/accounting-export?tour_id=…&format=quickbooks|xero` returns a bank-feed-shaped CSV ready for direct import. QuickBooks Online format: `Date, Description, Amount, Category` with expense amounts negative and our 10 expense categories mapped to QBO chart-of-account names. Xero format: `*Date, *Amount, Payee, Description, Reference, Account Code` with Xero account codes. Both reachable from the **Export for accounting** dropdown on `/tours/[id]/finances` next to the existing raw-CSV export
- ✅ Auto-populate state income from show revenue (DB function)

## Phase 15: Production Bible ✅
> Equipment inventory, stage plots, input lists, and venue notes.

- ✅ Equipment inventory (14 categories, condition tracking, travels/stays flag, serial numbers)
- ✅ Stage plots (name, dimensions, default flag, show association)
- ✅ Input lists / patch sheets (channel-by-channel with instrument, mic, DI, phantom power)
- ✅ Venue notes (searchable by venue name, categorized: load-in, parking, stage, sound, etc.)
- ✅ Production hub index with 4 section cards
- 📋 Drag-and-drop stage plot builder (visual editor)
- ✅ Auto-generated crew call sheets at `/tours/[id]/shows/[showId]/call-sheet` — assembles the day's brief from the advance sheet (times, venue, hospitality, dressing rooms, production notes), the tour&apos;s hotel booking for that show, and pinned + advance-sheet contacts. Print-friendly layout with `break-inside-avoid` per section; Print/PDF button on screen, hidden when printing. Deep-linked from the auth show page
- ✅ Rider compliance checklists — `org_rider_items` template per band at `/settings/rider-template` (categories: technical / hospitality / dressing room / crew / transportation / security / other). Per-show checklist at `/tours/[id]/shows/[showId]/rider`: import the template in one click, then production crew flips each line item to delivered / partial / missing / N/A at load-in with actual qty + notes. Snapshots the description at import time so historical compliance stays correct after the template evolves

## Phase 16: Subscriptions, CSV, & Email Docs ✅
> Billing, data import/export, and email setup documentation.

- ✅ Subscription system (lifetime $103.29 one-time + annual $103.29/yr after 100 lifetime sold)
- ✅ Pricing page with lifetime spots counter and annual unlock status
- ✅ Admin subscriptions dashboard (lifetime sold/remaining, annual count, total revenue)
- ✅ Promo code system (percentage/fixed discounts, max uses, expiry, lifetime grants)
- ✅ Stripe checkout API route (ready for STRIPE_SECRET_KEY config)
- ✅ CSV templates for 7 data types (shows, expenses, contacts, equipment, merch, subscribers, state income)
- ✅ Data Import/Export page with template downloads
- ✅ Email setup documentation in Help Center (Mailgun setup, DNS, API key, testing)
- ✅ Email Marketing academy course (3 lessons: building lists, campaigns, admin setup)
- ✅ Stripe Checkout session creation
- ✅ Webhook handler for Stripe events (checkout, cancellation, payment failure)
- ✅ CSV import wizard with column mapping and validation — `/data/import` with per-target flows for shows, expenses, and venue contacts; auto-matches columns by header label, previews 5 rows, runs row-by-row insert, surfaces row-level errors; `csv_imports` table logs every attempt for org-scoped history

## Phase 17: Email Integration ✅
> Send marketing emails with open/click tracking via Mailgun.

- ✅ Mailgun integration for email delivery (direct fetch client, region-aware)
- ✅ Campaign send action with batch processing (10 at a time)
- ✅ Open tracking via 1x1 pixel (auto-increments opened_count)
- ✅ Click tracking via redirect endpoint (auto-increments clicked_count)
- ✅ Unsubscribe link with confirmation page
- ✅ Campaign detail page with analytics (recipients, opens, clicks, open/click rates)
- ✅ Send button with confirmation dialog
- ✅ Mailgun webhook handler with HMAC signature verification (permanent failures + complaints auto-unsubscribe)
- ✅ HTML email template with tracking pixel and footer
- ✅ Graceful fallback when Mailgun not configured
- 📋 OAuth-connected email (Gmail/Outlook API) for sending from user's own address
- 📋 Emails appear in user's regular inbox

## Phase 18: Public API ✅
> RESTful API for third-party integrations.

- ✅ API key system (SHA-256 hashed, prefix display, scopes, rate limits)
- ✅ Key management page (/admin/api-keys) — create, view, revoke
- ✅ One-time key display with copy button (never shown again)
- ✅ API endpoints: GET /api/v1/tours, GET /api/v1/shows, GET /api/v1/itineraries
- ✅ Request logging (method, path, status, response time, IP)
- ✅ Developer docs page (/developers) — getting started, auth, endpoints, errors
- ✅ Free tier for testing, paid subscription for production use
- ✅ Webhook table ready (org-scoped, event filtering, secret hash)
- ✅ Additional endpoints — `GET /api/v1/finances/expenses` (tour_id + status filter + pagination), `GET /api/v1/merch/products` (active + category filter), `GET /api/v1/venues/contacts` (venue_id + role filter). All gated by the `read` scope and counted against the org&apos;s rate limit
- ✅ Rate limiting enforcement — per-key per-hour count against `api_logs` via `requireApiKey`; 429 response includes `X-RateLimit-*` + `Retry-After` headers
- ✅ OpenAPI/Swagger spec at `GET /api/v1/openapi` — hand-curated 3.1 spec with bearerAuth + Tour/Show/Expense/MerchProduct/VenueContact schemas. Public route so Swagger UI / ReDoc / Postman can import it directly. 5-minute browser cache + 10-minute CDN cache

## Phase 19: White Label ✅
> Branded versions for other bands/organizations.

- ✅ Branding settings: name, tagline, logo, favicon, primary color, font family, custom CSS
- ✅ White label enable/disable toggle
- ✅ Custom domain management with DNS verification (TXT record)
- ✅ SSL provisioning tracking
- ✅ Font selection (Inter, Poppins, Roboto, Open Sans, Montserrat, Lato)
- ✅ Color picker for primary brand color
- ✅ Enterprise subscription required
- ✅ Dynamic theme injection from org branding at runtime — `BrandTheme` server component on the authenticated layout reads the user&rsquo;s org `brand_primary_color` (when `white_label_enabled = true`), derives a 50/100/&hellip;/900 palette via HSL math (`shadesFromHex`), and emits an inline `<style>` setting the `--color-primary-*` CSS custom properties so every Tailwind primary class re-skins instantly. White-label admin form previews the derived shades next to the color picker
- 📋 Multi-tenant domain routing middleware

## Phase 20: Venue Network ✅
> Crowd-sourced venue database built from advance sheets.

- ✅ Venue directory with fuzzy search (pg_trgm) and type filtering
- ✅ Venue profiles: address, phone, capacity, stage dimensions, PA, parking, dressing rooms
- ✅ Multiple contacts per venue (booker, production, hospitality, sound, etc.) with primary-per-role flag — self-serve CRUD on `/venues/[id]`
- ✅ Global contacts search at `/contacts` — search by name / phone / email / role across every venue you can see, deep-link back to the venue profile
- ✅ Contact career-history on each venue contact card — &ldquo;Also at: Venue X, Venue Y&rdquo; line matches the same person (case-insensitive email or last-7-of-phone) across other venues, so you can spot when a booker moves jobs without maintaining a `people` registry
- ✅ Contact verified flag — band members tap the ShieldCheck button on a contact to mark &ldquo;I called this number, it works.&rdquo; Records `verified_at` + `verified_by`. Green Verified badge surfaces on the card; tap again to clear. Builds trust for contacts auto-imported from advance sheets that nobody&apos;s actually used yet.
- ✅ Contact tags + visibility groups — every contact takes free-form tags (&ldquo;handles VIP comps&rdquo;, &ldquo;load-in lead&rdquo;) rendered as inline chips. Team account managers create `contact_groups` at `/settings/contact-groups`, add contacts to them, and grant per-user visibility. Contacts NOT in any group remain visible to everyone (default). Contacts in a group are visible only to org owners/admins, the group creator, and explicit visibility members. Enforced via `user_can_see_contact()` SECURITY DEFINER + a `filter_visible_contacts()` batch RPC.
- ✅ Per-show contact overrides — on a show page, pin specific `venue_contacts` (optionally with a role override + free-form note like &ldquo;filling in for Jane&rdquo;) that take precedence over the venue&apos;s default contact list for that show only. Schema: `show_contacts(show_id, contact_id, role_override, note)`. UI: pin/unpin picker; defaults shown when no overrides exist.
- ✅ Star rating system (overall + sound, hospitality, load-in, dressing rooms)
- ✅ Review text with show date
- ✅ Venue notes integration (from Production Bible)
- ✅ Auto-create venue profiles from advance sheet data — wired into `submitAdvanceSheet` (best-effort, admin-client)
- ✅ Times-played counter and last-played date
- ✅ Smart advance pre-fill from past venue data — `getSmartAdvanceDefaults()` looks up the most-recent SUBMITTED advance for shows whose `venue_name` matches (case-insensitive ILIKE) and copies forward stable fields (venue info, dressing rooms, security, hospitality, stage dimensions, PA, merch area) into any current-sheet blanks. Time-sensitive fields (load-in/soundcheck/doors/curfew/ticket price) are intentionally excluded. A green &ldquo;Pre-filled from {venue} on {date}&rdquo; banner tells the submitter what was carried over
- ✅ Venue photos — Cloudinary-backed upload with lightbox viewer on `/venues/[id]`, up to 24 per venue (`app/api/venues/[id]/photos/route.ts`, `venue-photos.tsx`)
- ✅ Map view at `/venues/map` — Leaflet + OpenStreetMap tiles, every venue with lat/lng rendered as a marker, popup shows name/city/capacity/times-played + deep link to the venue profile, auto-fit bounds on load

## Phase 21: Multi-Act Touring ✅
> Tour packages, festival mode, cross-act coordination.

- ✅ Tour packages (tour/festival/residency types with status tracking)
- ✅ Act management (headliner/support/opener/special guest, set length, contacts)
- ✅ Production timeline — per-date shared timeline across all acts
- ✅ Timeline blocks: load-in, soundcheck, changeover, performance, doors, meet & greet, break, curfew
- ✅ Act-specific blocks (assign to individual act or all)
- ✅ Date selector for multi-day events
- ✅ Cross-act messaging at `/packages/[id]/messages` — single channel per tour package where any act on the bill can post. Senders can pick which act they speak as (drawn from the package&apos;s `package_acts` they have org access to) or post under their plain name. Snapshots sender name + act label at send time so historical posts stay correct after renames. New `package_messages` table; broad-auth RLS (any signed-in user can read/post; only the author can edit or delete their own)
- 📋 Festival mode (multiple stages)

## Phase 22: Wellness Platform ✅
> Health and wellbeing tools for life on the road, powered by CentenarianOS and Rise Wellness.

- ✅ Daily wellness log: sleep (hours + quality), energy, mood, stress, hydration, meals, exercise, warmup, performance rating, voice condition
- ✅ 7-day averages dashboard (sleep, energy, mood, voice)
- ✅ Warmup routines: 3 seeded (Vocal Basic, Physical Stage Ready, Breathing Recovery) with step-by-step instructions and timing
- ✅ Family check-ins: group prompts with mood emoji responses
- ✅ Rise Wellness of Indiana mental health resource card
- ✅ CentenarianOS promotion page (/wellness-resources) with exercise library links, workout links, platform CTA
- ✅ Medical disclaimer component
- ✅ Links to CentenarianOS public exercise library (110+ free exercises)
- ✅ Burnout detection at `/wellness/burnout` — 14-day weighted score across sleep, energy, mood, stress, voice, and schedule density, with contributing-signal breakdown + days-off-planner recommendations
- ✅ Days-off wellness suggestions (gyms, spas, parks, food, laundromats, family-friendly) — `suggestionLinks()` deep-links to Google Maps, scoped to last-known city
- 📋 Wearable integration (via CentenarianOS)

## Phase 24: Ticketing System ✅
> Sell tickets, scan QR codes at the door, audit every entry. Anti-counterfeit signed QRs.

- ✅ Schema: `ticket_types`, `tickets`, `scan_logs` with RLS for tour staff + purchasers
- ✅ Stripe Checkout flow: `POST /api/tickets/checkout` with inventory check, guest checkout
- ✅ Webhook ticket issuance: HMAC-signed QR codes, atomic `quantity_sold` increment, refund handling
- ✅ Public buy page at `/shows/[id]/tickets` — type picker, qty, guest email
- ✅ Holder page at `/tickets/[id]` — token-authed QR display, status-aware (used / refunded / void)
- ✅ Door scanner at `/tours/[id]/shows/[showId]/scanner` — @zxing/browser camera scan, manual fallback, vibration feedback
- ✅ Manager dashboard at `/tours/[id]/shows/[showId]/tickets` — sold/scanned/revenue/refunded, per-type breakdown, scan log
- ✅ Mailgun email delivery of ticket links with `?token=<sig>`
- ✅ `ticketing` module in `featurePages` registry → landing page at `/features/ticketing`
- 🚧 Stripe Connect split payments to artist/venue/crew (Phase 24.1) — schema + config UI shipped. New tables `stripe_connected_accounts` (per-org Express account) + `tour_revenue_splits` (per-tour basis-point allocations). `/admin/stripe-connect` runs the Express onboarding flow via Stripe `accountLinks`; `/tours/[id]/finances/splits` lets a manager configure who gets what cut and shows a "Total allocated: X%" gauge that goes green at 100%. **Transfer execution at payout still TBD** — current ticket + merch checkout still routes 100% to the platform account; the next pass wires Stripe Transfers against these rows once Connect is fully enabled on the platform Stripe account
- 📋 Apple/Google Wallet `.pkpass` ticket delivery
- ✅ Offline scanner cache — scanner pre-fetches a ticket manifest via `/api/tickets/manifest`, stores it in IndexedDB (`tmos.scanner` DB), and validates QRs offline when `navigator.onLine` flips false. Successful offline scans queue locally; the queue drains automatically when connectivity returns, replaying each scan with `offline_scanned_at` so the audit trail reflects door reality. `scan_logs` gains `offline_scanned_at` + `synced_from_offline` columns. A banner above the scanner shows online/offline state plus a "N queued" chip when scans are pending sync

## Phase 24.5: Fan Photo Sharing ✅
> Ticket-holders share show photos to a pre-moderated public wall. Each photo gets its own sharable link.

- ✅ Schema: `fan_photos` + `fan_photo_reports` with RLS (public reads approved, poster reads own, tour staff reads all states)
- ✅ `can_post_photos_for_show(uid, show_id)` SECURITY DEFINER function — ticket-holder gate at the database
- ✅ Server-signed Cloudinary uploads via `lib/cloudinary/server.ts` (CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET stays server-only)
- ✅ POST /api/fan-photos with eligibility + file-type + size guards (10MB max, jpeg/png/webp/heic)
- ✅ Rollback of orphan Cloudinary asset when DB insert fails
- ✅ GET /api/shows/[id]/fan-photos — public list of approved photos
- ✅ GET /api/admin/fan-photos/queue — staff moderation queue
- ✅ POST /api/admin/fan-photos/[id]/moderate — approve / reject / remove, with Cloudinary destroy on reject/remove and Mailgun rejection email
- ✅ Per-show photo wall at `/shows/[id]/photos` with ticket-holder-gated uploader
- ✅ `/photos/[id]` per-photo share page with OG + Twitter Card metadata
- ✅ Fan dashboard at `/photos` showing all submissions + statuses + rejection reasons
- ✅ Staff moderation at `/tours/[id]/shows/[showId]/fan-photos` (tabs, counts, reject-with-reason flow)
- ✅ `fan-photos` module registered in featurePages
- ✅ Post-publish abuse reports UI at `/admin/photo-reports` — open-first queue, photo thumbnail + reason + reporter inline, &ldquo;N open reports&rdquo; warning chip clusters repeat offenders, two resolution paths: Dismiss (kept up) or Take down (flips photo status to `rejected` and auto-resolves any sibling reports on the same image). Resolution notes required for takedown. Filter toggle between open-only and all
- ✅ Realtime moderation queue — `fan_photos` published to Supabase Realtime; the per-show moderation page subscribes to inserts/updates and silently refreshes the queue + counts within ~600 ms of a new submission. A pulsing &ldquo;connected&rdquo; badge plus a &ldquo;N new since you opened this&rdquo; chip make the live state obvious to moderators on duty
- ✅ AI-moderation pre-filter — every fan-photo upload runs through `moderatePhoto()` against the configured vision model right after the Cloudinary write. High-confidence NSFW or violence verdicts flip the row to `rejected` automatically with `ai_auto_rejected=true`; everything else lands in the human queue with the verdict attached so moderators can see what the model flagged before they review. New columns `ai_moderation_verdict`, `ai_moderated_at`, `ai_auto_rejected` on `fan_photos`

- ✅ `engines.node >= 20` pinned in `package.json` (runtime parity local ↔ Vercel)
- ✅ `toggleLockPost()` server action for community moderation (mirrors `togglePinPost`)
- ✅ Phase 24 Ticketing System (Stripe Checkout + HMAC QR + door scanner + manager dashboard)
